## About me
I am a first-year Ph.D. student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, advised by Professor Hongxia Yang. My research focuses on generative AI, primarily centered around Large Multimodal Models and AI agents, among other related areas.

Prior to joining PolyU, I worked at Tencent AI Lab and Tencent Hunyuan Team, where I was mainly responsible for the development and implementation of the Hunyuan Digital Human Language Model. 

Before that, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and my Master’s degree from New York University.

## Projects
- Design and Develope the Agent(NPC) system. It has been successfully deployed in three major games: DreamStar(元梦之星), Game for Peace(和平精英), and Honor of Kings(王者荣耀).
- Design and Develope the Medical AI systems for medication recommendation and prescription review in healthcare, which have been deployed in thousands of medical institutions.
